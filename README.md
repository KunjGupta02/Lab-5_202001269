● If you receive a "missing module docstring" error in Python, it means
that the module is missing a docstring. To fix this error, you can simply
add a docstring to the module. docstring should be enclosed in triple
quotes ("""), and the first line of the docstring should be a short,
concise summary of what the module does.<br>
● The "too few public methods" error message in Python typically
indicates that the class doesn't have enough methods that are
intended to be used by other code outside the class. If a class has too
few public methods, it can be a sign that the class is not well-designed
or that it doesn't have enough functionality to be useful.<br>
● The "no name 'Final' in module 'typing'" error message in Python occurs
when you try to use the Final type hint, but it is not defined in the
typing module. The Final type hint is used to indicate that a variable or
attribute should not be reassigned after it is initialized.<br>

● If you receive a "missing function docstring" error in Python, it means
that your function definition does not include a docstring. This error
can occur when running a code analysis tool, such as a linter or a static
analyzer, that checks for adherence to best practices in coding.<br>
● In Python, the "statement seems to have no effect" error usually occurs
when you have written a statement that does not have any noticeable
effect on the program's output or behavior.To fix this error, you should
either remove the statement entirely or modify it to have a meaningful
effect on the program's behavior.<br><br>

● The “unable to import pyfakefs” error in Python usually occurs when
you try to import the pyfakefs library, but it is not installed or not
installed correctly.<br>
● The "invalid argument name fs" error can occur in Python when you are
trying to pass an argument with the name fs to a function or method,
but fs is not a valid or recognized argument name.The pyfakefs library
provides a fake file system for testing purposes, and it uses an
argument named fs in some of its functions and methods. However, if
you try to use fs as an argument name in your own code, it may
conflict with the pyfakefs library and cause this error.<br>
● If you receive a "missing module docstring" error in Python, it means
that the module is missing a docstring. To fix this error, you can simply
add a docstring to the module. docstring should be enclosed in triple
quotes ("""), and the first line of the docstring should be a short,
concise summary of what the module does.<br><br>

● The "unable to import" error in Python occurs when the Python
interpreter is unable to find and load a module or package that you
are trying to import in your code. If you are trying to import a module
or package that is not installed on your system or in the current Python
environment, you will get an "unable to import" error.<br>
● If you receive a "missing module docstring" error in Python, it means
that the module is missing a docstring. To fix this error, you can simply
add a docstring to the module. docstring should be enclosed in triple
quotes ("""), and the first line of the docstring should be a short,
concise summary of what the module does.<br>
● The "value is unsubscriptable" error in Python occurs when you try to
apply a subscript to a value that cannot be subscripted. This error can
occur due to several reasons like incorrect data type, type in variable
name, immutable data type.<br><br>

● In Python, the "exactly one space required after comma" error occurs
when you use too many or too few spaces after a comma in a function
call or a tuple. This error can occur when you have either no spaces or
more than one space after a comma, which violates the Python style
guide.<br>
● If you receive a "missing module docstring" error in Python, it means
that the module is missing a docstring. To fix this error, you can simply
add a docstring to the module. docstring should be enclosed in triple
quotes ("""), and the first line of the docstring should be a short,
concise summary of what the module does.<br>
● In Python, the "bad indentation" error occurs when there are
inconsistencies in the indentation level of your code. Python relies on
proper indentation to determine the scope of a block of code, such as a
function definition or a loop, so any errors in indentation can cause
syntax errors and unexpected behavior.
